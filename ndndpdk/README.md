# 5gdeploy/ndndpdk

Package **ndndpdk** integrates [NDN-DPDK](https://github.com/usnistgov/ndn-dpdk) as a UPF implementation.
This package offers these choices in the **netdef-compose** command:

* `--up=ndndpdk`: NDN-DPDK UPF

5gdeploy does not build NDN-DPDK Docker images because compilation options are hardware dependent.
You must [build the `localhost/ndn-dpdk` container image](https://github.com/usnistgov/ndn-dpdk/blob/main/docs/Docker.md) and make it available on each UPF host.

## NDN-UPF

NDN-DPDK has preliminary support for running as a 5G UPF.
The UPF terminates GTPv1U tunnels of IPv4 PDU sessions, where each PDU session is a face in the NDN-DPDK forwarder.
UEs can then send/receive NDN packets, encapsulated in IPv4 and UDP, through the PDU sessions.

Typically, you can designate one Data Network for NDN traffic, and keep other Data Networks for IP traffic.
Specify `--up=UPF-NAME=ndndpdk` flag to select NDN-DPDK for the UPF serving the NDN Data Network.
Then, specify a general `--up` flag after this flag to select a different UPF implementation for other UPFs.
For example: `--up=upf6=ndndpdk --up=free5gc`.

The NDN UPF requires two containers:

* NDN-UPF service (`ndndpdk-upf`): always created by 5gdeploy
* NDN-DPDK service (`ndndpdk-svc`): optionally created by 5gdeploy

### NDN-UPF with Manual NDN-DPDK Activation

The entrypoint script of the NDN-UPF service performs these steps:

1. Wait for N4, N3, N6 netifs to become ready.
2. Wait for NDN-DPDK forwarder to become ready and have an EthDev on the N3 netif.
3. If the N3 IPv4 address is not found within the container, create a pass-through face on the EthDev, and assign the N3 IPv4 address to the associated TAP netif.
   This enables the UPF to respond to ARP queries.
4. Launch the `ndndpdk-upf` process.

For step 2 to succeed, you must manually perform these steps:

1. Launch a separate NDN-DPDK service container, attached to the netns of the UPF service container (i.e. `--network container:upf6`).
2. If the EthDev on the N3 netif would be using rte\_mlx5 PCI driver, delete the IPv4 address on the N3 netif.
3. Activate NDN-DPDK service as a forwarder.
4. Create an EthDev on the N3 netif.

Once these steps are completed, the UPF would be launched and start responding to PFCP commands from the SMF.
When the SMF instructs the UPF to establish/release a GTPv1U tunnel, the UPF would create/destroy a face in the NDN-DPDK forwarder.
Currently there's no way to modify FIB entries, which means the UEs can only act as consumers.

### NDN-UPF with Automatic NDN-DPDK Activation

When `--ndndpdk-activate` flag is provided, the NDN-DPDK service is created through the Compose file.
This flag should refer to a directory that contains JSON files named after the UPFs, such as `upf6.json`.
Each file must contain a JSON object that is NDN-DPDK forwarder activation parameters, with an additional field "5gdeploy-create-eth-port" that contains `ndndpdk-ctrl create-eth-port` command line parameters.

In the entrypoint script of the NDN-UPF service, step 2 is replaced with these sub-steps:

1. Activate NDN-DPDK forwarder with the provided activation parameters.
2. Create EthDev with the provided command line parameters.

The CPU allocation of the NDN-DPDK service shall be specified in the activation parameters.
CPUSET in the `--place` flag shall be omitted.
